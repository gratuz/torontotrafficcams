torontotrafficcams
==================

Here are a set of html and javascript files that display the current picture of some toronto traffic cameras.

The set itself was made available by Toronto's Open Data portal (http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9525a89f92491410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD). However, there data was a csv file and I found it cumbersome to work with csv. I've moved the data into a database that makes access much easier and have started building a service around that data set.

This repo is restricted to a set of javascript and html files that allow viewing of the images.
